      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

              <p>
                Hey, welcome to my website. A little about myself: I'm Dutch Brazillian and have lived in various countries, so I wouldn’t identify myself specifically either. <br> I’m currently studying at The Hague University of Applied Sciences to become an User Experience Designer.<br>Additionally I’m always looking to further improve my skills as a Front-End Developer and all around programming skills.<br> So, take a look around and see if anything piques your interest and maybe you’ll get in touch.
              </p>
